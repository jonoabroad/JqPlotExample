JQPlot example

A quick and dirty example showing JQPlot running within Liftweb.
         
Running & deploying 
 
1. sbt 
2. > reload
3. > update
4. > eclipse 
5. > jetty

point a browser (Not IE) at http://localhost:8080/

I didn't have time to work out why It doesn' work with IE. 

Works with:

Chrome  13.0X
Opera   11.5
Firefix 5.0
Safari  5.1
